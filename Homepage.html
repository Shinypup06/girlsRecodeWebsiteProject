        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Are you a woman that has a lot of male coworkers? Do you ever notice that males tend to get paid more than women do? 
            WPTA stands for Women's Pay Transparency Association. Here, we prioritize changing the pay trends that women tend
            to face in male dominated industries. For centuries, we have had to serve and treat men as our superiors. WPTA was
            created to help the world see that women are equals too. Women have been belittled for far too long and it is time 
            for a change to occur. 
        </p>

        <h2>How can we bridge the gap?</h2>
        <p>
            research about how worker unions and increased pay transparency help reduce the wage gap
            <!-- REFERENCE ARTICLE: https://www.moneyunder30.com/strategies-for-narrowing-the-gender-pay-gap -->
        </p>

        <h2>What is WPTA? </h2>
        <p>
            who are we and how we're combining both of these aspects to help bridge the gap
        </p>

        <h2>How we can help</h2>
        <p>
            how we can help by 
            1. motivating companies to pay more fairly by increasing competition and 
            2. helping women by letting them know which companies pay more fairly than others
        </p>

        <h2>Our Survey</h2>
        <p>We are basing our data off of this quick survey that takes around two minutes to complete. Please help us out by filling it out, and sharing it with others! We want to gather as wide a sample as possible so that we can more accurately calculate pay gaps and to reduce outliers in the data set.</p>
