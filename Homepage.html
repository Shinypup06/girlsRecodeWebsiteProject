        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Are you a woman that has a lot of male coworkers? Do you ever notice that males tend to get paid more than women do? 
            WPTA stands for Women's Pay Transparency Association. Here, we prioritize changing the pay trends that women tend
            to face in male dominated industries. For centuries, we have had to serve and treat men as our superiors. WPTA was
            created to help the world see that women are equals too. Women have been belittled for far too long and it is time 
            for a change to occur. Fun fact, women are paid 81 cents for every dollar that is earned by a man in 2020. That is 
            19 cents less than a man would make. This has improved from previous statistics, I.e., in 2015 women were paid up to
            74 cents for every dollar a man made in 2015. Even with the acknowledged gap between the two, there are still many 
            women who do not feel comfortable negotiating their salaries. 
        </p>
        <h2>What is WPTA? </h2>
        <p>
           We are an organization that has a passion for gender equality in the workforce. There are many instances that continue to create a wider gap between gender equality in the working industry
            . Our mission is to help bridge the gap between gender inequality by taking the survey answers we recieve from our
            website and comparing the statistics. We want to spread awareness with this project by bringing people's attention
            to the gap in pay between different genders. Here we will help other women who may have concerns or need assistance in finding a better job with improved salaries.
             We help all women alike, as we are different women ourselves. Here, there is no judgement nor hate, all is welcome.  
        </p>

        <h2>How can we bridge the gap?</h2>

            <!-- REFERENCE ARTICLE: https://www.moneyunder30.com/strategies-for-narrowing-the-gender-pay-gap -->
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Many gender inequalities in the workplace can stem from informal recruitment processes in male-dominated industries. To ratio this, recruiters should make their informal shortlist longer.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Employers can promote gender equality by becoming more transparent about wages to ensure that there is no difference in salaries due to the difference in gender. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Employers are encouraged to use skills-based assesssments as well as structured interviews to reduce the number of workers that may not be cut out for the job as well as an unfair bias whether it be gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, etc. </li>
            <br>
            <li>There may be times when women are smarter or more experienced in certain areas than men. With this, we can make both genders more comfortable by offering classes where both can teach what they know or have learned to each other.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>How we can help?</h2>
        <p>
            By taking survey results and showing the comparisons, we are spreading awareness and spotlighting the issue of the pay gap. With this, we hope to encourgae more companies to equalize the pay between males and gender minority.
            We also want to help females in different fields by letting them know which companies pay more fairer than others. 
            Our graphs show the pay gap between male and gender minority workers in various companies, so if a somone is weighing the pros and cons between companies to decide which one to choose, our graphs could support them.
            The graphs are shown on our "View the Statistics" page linked below!

        <p>We are basing our data off of this quick survey that takes around two minutes to complete. Please help us out by filling it out, and sharing it with others! We want to gather as wide a sample as possible so that we can more accurately calculate pay gaps and to reduce outliers in the data set.</p>
