    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
        Are you a woman that has a lot of male coworkers? Do you ever notice that males tend to get paid more than women do? 
        WPTA stands for Women's Pay Transparency Association. Here, we prioritize changing the pay trends that women tend
        to face in male dominated industries. For centuries, we have had to serve and treat men as our superiors. WPTA was
        created to help the world see that women are equals too. Women have been belittled for far too long and it is time 
        for a change to occur.

    <h2>How we can help</h2>
    <p>
        how we can help by 
        1. motivating companies to pay more fairly by increasing competition and 
        2. helping women by letting them know which companies pay more fairly than others
