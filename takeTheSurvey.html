                <li>Q: Can I still take the survey if I am a male?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A: Yes! In fact, it is encouraged so that our data can better analyze the pay difference between males and females. We need participants from both demographics in order to get a fair representation. By completing this survey, even as a male, you are helping your female counterparts achieve fairer pay in the workplace, so, thank you!
