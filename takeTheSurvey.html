                <li>Q: Can I still take the survey if I am a male?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A: Yes! In fact, it is encouraged so that our data can better analyze the pay difference between males and females. We need participants from both demographics in order to get a fair representation. By completing this survey, even as a male, you are helping your female counterparts achieve fairer pay in the workplace, so, thank you!

                    A: We do not share your individual data with anyone. The only place where our data is reported is on the statistics page of our website, but this data is an average of all previous responses, so do not worry! Your info will never be directly shared. We will never send data to any third parties without permission.
